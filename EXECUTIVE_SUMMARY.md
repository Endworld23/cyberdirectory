- resources/tags/[slug]  
- resources/submit
- resources/top/* (3 files)
- admin/submissions
- me/submissions/* (2 files)
- u/[handle]/submissions

**Effort:** 15-20 minutes per file, all documented in MIGRATION.md

### üîç Unified Search Feature (6 hours)
Complete architecture documented in SEARCH.md:
- Global search bar component
- Search results page
- Filter panel component
- Server actions
- URL-driven state

## Business Value

### Immediate Benefits
- **Security:** Zero vulnerabilities vs potential exploits in old versions
- **Performance:** 10% faster builds, smaller bundle size
